/**
 * A private class to manage group views in an HLSContainerStackView. Such a view has at most two subviews,
 * one for the front content (mandatory and which cannot be changed), and another one for the back content 
 * (optional, and which can be changed).
 *
 * Each of those views is wrapped into a transparent wrapper view with alpha = 1.f, which must be used
 * for animations. This way animations can safely assume they animate views with alpha = 1.f. If we had 
 * animated the content views directly, which can have arbitrary alpha values, this would not have been 
 * possible. Moreover, this additional wrapping yields smoother animations (I cannot explain why, though.
 * Probably blending can be performed more efficiently)
 *
 * Designated initializer: -initWithFrame:frontView:
