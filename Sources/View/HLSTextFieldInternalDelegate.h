/**
 * A UITextField cannot be its own delegate (this leads to infinite recursion when entering edit mode of a text field
 * which is its own delegate). In general, it is probably better to avoid having an object being its own delegate anyway. 
 * If we want to trap text field delegate events to perform additional tasks, we therefore need an additional object as 
 * delegate, and having the real text field delegate as this object's delegate. This is just the purpose of this (private) 
 * HLSTextFieldInternalDelegate class. To use it, simply inherit from it, and implement the delegate methods you need
 * (calling the super method in their implementation)
 *
 * Designated initializer: -initWithTextField:
