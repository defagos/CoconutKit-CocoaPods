/**
 * This class is a container for task objects to be submitted simultaneously. Do not inherit from this class,
 * subclass HLSTask to implement your custom task logic, and use HLSTaskGroup for submitting many custom tasks
 * at once. This allows you to track not only the individual status of each task, but also the overall progress
 * of the task group. Moreover, dependencies between tasks can be set, which is impossible to achieve when
 * submitting single tasks.
 *
 * A task group must not be submitted several times simultaneously (this leads to undefined behavior). A task 
 * group which was fully processed can be submitted again (and with another delegate if needed), but must not be 
 * already running.
 *
 * Designated initializer: -init:
