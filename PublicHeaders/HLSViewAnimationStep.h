/**
 * A view animation step (HLSViewAnimationStep) is the combination of several view animations (HLSViewAnimation) applied
 * to a set of views, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval. An animation
 * (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps, either view-based (HLSViewAnimationStep) or layer-based 
 * (HLSLayerAnimationStep).
 *
 * To create a view animation step, simply instantiate it using the +animationStep class method, then add view animations
 * to it, and set its duration and curve
 *
 * Designated initializer: -init (create an animation step with default settings)
