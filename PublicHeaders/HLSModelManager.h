/**
 * A model manager is a lightweight wrapper around a Core Data managed object context, eliminating most of the 
 * usual boilerplate you have to write when creating stores and contexts, and providing some additional convenience 
 * methods to make your life easier.
 *
 * Several model managers can coexist in an application. Two design rationales have been taken into account:
 *   - you usually interact with one managed object context per thread. You may need to create another one, 
 *     but interaction should be restricted to one context at a time. Note that this is a best practice, not 
 *     a Core Data technical limitation
 *   - Core Data contexts must not be shared among threads
 *   - contexts rarely need to be accessed directly. Database operations should therefore implicitly always 
 *     be performed in the current thread's active context
 * 
 * Based on those rationales, HLSModelManager provides a way to manage a stack of model manager objects (i.e. 
 * of contexts) on a thread basis. You now simply push the model manager you want to work with onto the stack and
 * call context-free methods from NSManagedObject+HLSExtensions.h to act on it. This eliminates the need to
 * refer to managed object contexts explicitly, which is error-prone, especially in the context of multithreaded
 * applications.
 *
 * As a programmer you are most likely to use model managers as follows:
 *   - create a model manager on the main thread, and push it onto the main thread model manager stack
 *   - perform database operations using the context-free methods of NSManagedObject+HLSExtensions.h
 *   - if you need to work in another context, duplicate the current model manager (by calling the -duplicate
 *     method) and push the new instance onto the stack. Perform database operations using the context-free 
 *     methods of NSManagedObject+HLSExtensions.h. When you are done, pop the current model manager off the 
 *     stack
 *   - go on working with the previously pushed model manager
 *   - if you need to perform database operations on another thread, duplicate the current context and push 
 *     the new instance onto the other thread model manager stack
