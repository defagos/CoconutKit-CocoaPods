/**
 * This class conveniently implements the UISearchDisplayController behavior for a table view (the most common case). It 
 * manages two table views:
 *   - one table view displaying all entries when the search interface is inactive (tableView)
 *   - one table view displaying only matching entries when the search interface is active (searchResultsTableView)
 * To create your own table view with search interface, subclass HLSTableSearchDisplayViewController and override 
 * the UISearchDisplayDelegate delegate methods to suit your needs.
 *
 * To provide the user with the ability to customize the view controller layout, this class does not inherit directly from
 * UITableViewController, but from HLSViewController. Classes derived from this class are therefore expected to initialize
 * the table view outlet provided, either using Interface Builder or programmatically.
 *
 * As for UITableViewController, this class conforms to the table view protocols for convenience, but does not provide
 * any meaningful implementations for them. Subclasses are required to override at least the required UITableViewDataSource
 * protocol methods displaying records (-tableView:numberOfRowsInSection: and -tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:). When
 * implementing these methods, you can use the tableView and searchResultsTableView accessors to identify which table
 * view is querying the data source. This allows you to use the proper record set.s
 *
 * You never need to reload the table views of a HLSTableSearchDisplayViewController directly. Instead, implement the
 *              -searchDisplayController:shouldReloadTableForSearchString:
 *      and     -searchDisplayController:shouldReloadTableForSearchScope:
 * UISearchDisplayDelegate methods to return YES when the table view needs reloading. These methods are called each 
 * time the search string or the search scope are changed.
 *
 * HLSTableSearchDisplayViewController saves the current search criteria and restore them if the view has been
 * unloaded. You do not have to code this mechanism yourself.
 *
 * This class only implements the standard UISearchDisplayController behavior (scope buttons are only active when a
 * search string has been entered). Having scope buttons active even if no search criterium is entered requires
 * further investigation (it would be nice to implement this behavior using UISearchDisplayController. Otherwise
 * we must code everything from scratch, with tricky animations requiring access to private implementation details,
 * layouts different for portrait and landscape orientations, etc. Not an easy task.
 *
 * Remark: If you override -viewDidLoad, -viewWillAppear, etc., do not forget to call their super counterpart (as usual),
 *         otherwise the behavior is undefined. The same holds for the UISearchDisplayDelegate methods
 *
 * Designated initializer: -initWithNibName:bundle:
