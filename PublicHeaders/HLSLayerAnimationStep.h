/**
 * A layer animation step (HLSLayerAnimationStep) is the combination of several layer animations (HLSLayerAnimation) applied
 * to a set of layers, and represent the collective set of changes applied to them during some time interval. An animation
 * (HLSAnimation) is then simply a collection of animation steps, either view-based (HLSViewAnimationStep) or layer-based
 * (HLSLayerAnimationStep).
 *
 * To create a layer animation step, simply instantiate it using the +animationStep class method, then add layer animations
 * to it, and set its duration and curve
 *
 * Designated initializer: -init (create an animation step with default settings)
