/**
 * Segue class for setting the inset view controller of an HLSPlaceholderViewController when using storyboards.
 *
 * The source view controller must either be a placeholder view controller, or a view controller already installed
 * as inset view controller of a placeholder view controller. The source view controller can implement the 
 * -prepareForSegue:sender: method to further customize transition properties (index, transition style and duration)
 *
 * A view controller can be preloaded into a placeholder view controllers by binding the placeholder view controller
 * with it using a segue with the reserved identifier 'hls_preload_at_index__N', where N is the index at which the view 
 * controller must be initially loaded. This index must be between 0 and 19, which allows preloading of 20 view 
 * controllers. This should be sufficient: Though a placeholder view controller can hold more than 20 view controllers,
 * this should never occur in practice
