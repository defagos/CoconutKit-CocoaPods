/**
 * Lightweight view controller subclass adding useful stuff to UIViewController, and which should be always used as 
 * base class when creating view controller subclasses in projects using CoconutKit (provided you do not have to 
 * subclass an existing view controller subclass which does not inherit from HLSViewController, of course).
 *
 * HLSViewController provides you with the following features:
 *   - localization is isolated in a single method. This is not only convenient to have a single place for localization code, 
 *     but this also makes HLSViewController compatible with the NSBundle+HLSDynamicLocalization.h class extension, making
 *     it possible to change a view controller localization at runtime (if this is not needed, HLSViewController of course
 *     remains compatible with the usual way of changing localization via system preferences, but it is stil good practice
 *     to collect localization code in a single method anyway)
 *   - view cleanup (-releaseViews) and general cleanup (-dealloc) are separated, enforcing good practices and eliminating
 *     potentially redundant code
 *   - instead of the default nib resolution mechanism of -[UIViewController init] (for @class MyViewController, first
 *     locate MyView.nib, then MyViewController.nib), HLSViewController subclasses look for a nib bearing the same name
 *     as the class only (otherwise the view controller is assumed to be instantiated programmatically). This promotes 
 *     a consistent naming scheme between source and nib files
 *   - view controllers inheriting from HLSViewController MUST implement autorotation behavior using the new iOS 6 
 *     -shouldAutorotate and -supportedInterfaceOrientations methods, not the old -shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:
 *     method anymore. This way, no code has to be duplicated to implement autorotation behavior for iOS 4 / 5 and 6
 *   - the way how methods must be overridden is clean and consistent: The rule is now "Always call the super implementation 
 *     first" (if failing to do so, the behavior is undefined). This includes all view lifecycle methods, rotation methods,
 *     as well as -localize and -didReceiveMemoryWarning
 *
 * The HLSViewController class is not meant to be instantiated directly, you should subclass it to define your own view 
 * controllers.
 *
 * Otherwise, HLSViewController is used exactly like UIViewController. There is only one major difference with 
 * UIViewController: HLSViewController supports all interface orientations by default. This choice was made so that 
 * the "Always call the super implementation first" rule can be applied. This also makes sense from a user's perspective 
 * since view controllers tend to support more and more orientations (especially since the iPad was launched, or more 
 * recently with the autorotation behavior introduced in iOS 6).
 *
 * This class also provides a way to debug view controller events (lifecycle, rotation, memory warnings). You must
 * set the logger level of your application to DEBUG (see HLSLogger.h to know how this is achieved). Then use the 
 * console when running your application to have a look at view controller events. This most notably can help you 
 * discover incorrect view controller hierarchies or poorly implemented view controller containers.

 *     subclass retains view controllers to avoid creating their views too often ("view caching"), also set the views of thesee view 
 *     controllers to nil in this method. If you are subclassing a class already subclassing HLSViewController, always send the 
 *     -releaseViews message to super first.
