/**
 * Concrete class responsible for instantiating, processing and managing HLSTaskOperation objects spawned for each
 * task submitted to it. Each such object represents a work unit processed by a dedicated thread.
 *
 * A delegation mechanism is used to notify clients about the task processing status. Objects register themselves
 * to get notified about a task status. Note that a delegate registration is removed automatically when the 
 * associated task processing ends. This means that when you are re-submitting a task you will need to register
 * a delegate even if one was already registered for this task.
 *
 * As always with delegation in asynchronous contexts, it is especially important that delegates do not forget to
 * unregister themselves before they get destroyed, otherwise crashes are likely to occur if operations are still
 * running when their delegate dies. To avoid such issues, never forget to call -unregisterDelegateAndCancelAssociatedTasks:
 * or -unregisterDelegate in the dealloc method of your delegates. This will unregister the delegate, ensuring that
 * it cannot be notified anymore when it gets destroyed.
 *
 * This object is not thread-safe. All operations on it must stem from the same thread, otherwise the behavior is 
 * undefined.
 *
 * Designated initializer: -init
